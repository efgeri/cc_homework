# TDD Lab

## Learning Objective

- Practice problem solving with TDD


## Task

Choose a problem to solve from **High Scores**, **Football Results**, **Matrix** and **Compound Interest Calculator**. (The last two are tricky)

Take a copy of the ```start_code``` directory and rename it to ```tdd_lab```

Initialise your directory with Git:

```
cd tdd_lab
git init
```

Using the start code, write your test, get it to fail and then get it to pass.
Repeat.
